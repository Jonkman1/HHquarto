We agree in principle with many of the elements of the report prepared by the committee, but we felt that there were some key elements heard during witness testimony that we believe were under-represented in the report. Of these, we wanted to highlight the following points: that the government commit to concrete action in simplifying the overly complex procurement process for small businesses; that it reduce the red tape in the process so that small and medium-sized enterprises can access and fairly compete on federal procurement opportunities; and that it ensure that the federal departments involved in managing procurement projects understand their role in contributing to meaningful reform. 
We were provided with incredibly strong testimony throughout the study, and we want to thank the many witnesses who took time out of their busy schedules to contribute their knowledge and expertise to the study.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce an act to amend PIPEDA, our privacy laws for the commercial sector.
 The bill aims to implement our parliamentary privacy committee's unanimous recommendations to strengthen the enforcement powers of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, including the power to make orders, and broader discretion to audit organizations for compliance with our laws. What we have is an ombudsman. What we need is a regulator. The bill also provides for significant financial sanctions where organizations intentionally or recklessly breach our privacy rights. Where organizations obtain a financial benefit from using our personal information, they should suffer a financial loss when they misuse our personal information. If we take privacy seriously, we need both strong rules and a strong privacy regulator.

I would like to begin by acknowledging the work of Senator Bovey, from my home province of Manitoba, and Senator Moore of Nova Scotia, in the creation of this bill and thank them for their work in moving it forward in the other chamber.
This bill gives parliamentarians the opportunity to send a clear message to Canada's artistic community that we appreciate and recognize the importance of its work not only to our country's culture, but also to our society's economy.
Furthermore, the position of an artist laureate would enable artists from all regions of Canada and of different backgrounds to have a national platform to showcase their work. Arts and culture is one of the most powerful tools we have for making social change. This bill celebrates artists and recognizes their importance to this great country of Canada.
